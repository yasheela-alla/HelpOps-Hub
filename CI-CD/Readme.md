## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before setting up the CI/CD pipeline, ensure you have the following:
- A GitLab account 🧑‍💻
- A GitLab project repository 📁
- GitLab Runner installed (optional for local testing) 🏃‍♂️

## 📂 Project Setup

1. **Create a New Repository**: 
   - Go to your GitLab account.
   - Click on **New Project** and follow the instructions to create a new repository.
   
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://gitlab.com/username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

## 🛠️ Configure GitLab Runner

1. **Register GitLab Runner**:
   - Install GitLab Runner by following the [official documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/).
   - Register the runner using:
     ```sh
     sudo gitlab-runner register
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to configure the runner.

## 📄 Create `.gitlab-ci.yml` File

1. **Create the File**:
   - In the root of your repository, create a file named `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
     ```sh
     touch .gitlab-ci.yml
     ```

2. **Basic Structure**:
   ```yaml
   stages:
     - build
     - test
     - deploy
   ```

## 🔄 Continuous Integration (CI) Configuration

1. **Build Stage**:
   ```yaml
   build:
     stage: build
     script:
       - echo "Compiling the code..."
       - # Add your build commands here
   ```

2. **Test Stage**:
   ```yaml
   test:
     stage: test
     script:
       - echo "Running tests..."
       - # Add your test commands here
   ```

## 🚢 Continuous Deployment (CD) Configuration

1. **Deploy Stage**:
   ```yaml
   deploy:
     stage: deploy
     script:
       - echo "Deploying the application..."
       - # Add your deployment commands here
     environment:
       name: production
       url: http://your-app-url.com
   ```

## ✅ Running the Pipeline

1. **Push Changes**:
   - Add, commit, and push your changes to the repository.
   ```sh
   git add .gitlab-ci.yml
   git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Pipeline Execution**:
   - Navigate to your GitLab project.
   - Go to **CI/CD > Pipelines** to view the running pipeline.

3. **Review Pipeline Status**:
   - Check the status of each stage and job.
   - Fix any issues if necessary and re-run the pipeline.
