## Introduction to DevOpsüëã
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is built on a culture of collaboration between teams, automation of processes, and a focus on measurable results.

### üìå Key Concepts ‚úÖ:
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Regularly integrating code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automatically deploying code changes to a production environment after passing the CI pipeline.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Continuously observing systems to identify and troubleshoot issues.
- **Security and Compliance**: Integrate security and ensure compliance in DevOps workflows.
